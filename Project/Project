## OngoBoost Insight Project
=========================

As a part of Insight Datascience fellowship, I consulted for a fitness app manufacturing company. There were several facets in 
the project.


Part A. AppleHealthKitData Analysis
===================================
This part mostly deals with customer who syncs their historic data from 3rd party integration (mostly AppleHealthKitData)
to the client's fitness app. There were 23M+ (>10GB)observations. These data required extensive cleaning, data wrangling, 
feature engineering before using for clustering. After that I analyzed what features (behavioral patterns) segragate customers 
into different clusters.




Part B. The Run Experience App Utilization (Data 1) Analysis
============================================================

This part mostly deals with preprocessing the in-app behavior of the customers and then integrated that with meaningful features coming from 
AppleHealthKitData, to predict subscription. This dataset was highly imbalanced for subscription.



Part C. The Run Experience App Utilization (Data 2) Analysis
============================================================
Here, I used a different dataset with a more balanced subscription, integrated data from Part A, in order to 
predict subscription.
