OngoBoost Insight Project
=========================

As a part of Insight Datascience fellowship, I consulted for a fitness app manufacturing company. There were several facets in 
the project.


Part A. AppleHealthKitData Analysis
===================================
This part mostly deals with customer who syncs their historic data from 3rd party integration (mostly AppleHealthKitData)
to the client's fitness app. There were 23M+ (>10GB)observations. These data required extensive cleaning, data wrangling, 
feature engineering before using for clustering. After that I analyzed what features (behavioral patterns) segragate customers 
into different clusters.


In Part B, I preprocessed the in-app behavior of the customers and then integrated that with meaningful features coming from 
AppleHealthKitData, to predict subscription. This dataset was highly imbalanced for subscription.

In Part C., I used a different dataset with a more balanced subscription, integrated data from Part A and Part B, in order to 
predict subscription.
