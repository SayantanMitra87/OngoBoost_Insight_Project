Part 1. AppleHealthKitData Analysis
===================================

This part mostly deals with customer who syncs their historic data from 3rd party integration (most AppleHealthKitData)
with the client's fitness app. There were 23M+ (>10GB)observations. These data required extensive cleaning, data wrangling, 
feature engineering before using for clustering. After that I analyzed what features (behavioral patterns) segragate customers 
into different clusters.
